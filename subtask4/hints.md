## Hint 1 (Slight):

To implement the Markdown preview feature:
1. Use the `pulldown_cmark` crate for Markdown to HTML conversion.


## Hint 2 (Medium):

2. Consider using a lightweight web framework like `warp` or `tiny_http` for serving the preview.
3. The `open` crate can be useful for launching the default web browser.


## Hint 3 (Strong):

To integrate the preview feature with the existing editor:
1. Add a new field to the `App` struct to manage the preview state.
2. Implement the `:browser` command in the command mode.
3. When the command is executed, start the preview server if it's not already running, then open the browser.
4. Ensure the preview server is properly shut down when the editor closes.
