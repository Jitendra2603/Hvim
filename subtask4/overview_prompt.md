#### **Hints for Implementing Browser-Based Markdown Rendering**

1. **Slight Hint:**
   - **Set up a simple HTTP server in Rust.**  
   You'll need a crate like `warp` to handle serving HTTP requests. Define a route that serves the HTML output of the rendered Markdown file. Investigate the `warp::serve` function and how it integrates with async Rust.

2. **Medium Hint:**
   - **Convert Markdown to HTML using `pulldown_cmark`.**  
   Use `pulldown_cmark` to convert your Markdown content into HTML. This crate allows parsing and rendering of Markdown content. The flow would involve converting the content in your editor into HTML and passing it to your HTTP server to serve.

   **Key Code Tip**: After getting the Markdown content, use something like:
   ```rust
   let parser = pulldown_cmark::Parser::new_ext(markdown_text, Options::all());
   let mut html_output = String::new();
   pulldown_cmark::html::push_html(&mut html_output, parser);
   ```

3. **Big Hint:**
   - **Automatically open the browser to show the rendered content.**  
   After starting your HTTP server, use the `open` crate to open the browser automatically. The command `open::that("http://127.0.0.1:3030")` will open the system's default browser to the correct port.

   **Key Code Tip**: When handling the `:browser` command, check if the server is already running. If not, spawn the server using Tokio's runtime:
   ```rust
   if let Err(e) = open::that("http://127.0.0.1:3030") {
       eprintln!("Failed to open browser: {}", e);
   }
   ```
   Then, make sure you serve the HTML content as the response in the `warp` server.
