# Hints for Implementing the Code

## Slight Hint
The main file to focus on is `Main.hs` in the `app` folder, which initializes the editor by reading command-line arguments. The key function that kicks off the editor is `startEditor` from the `UI.Display` module. Ensure your file path argument is handled correctly.

## Medium Hint
To understand how the editor displays content and handles user input, explore `UI.Display` and `UI.EventHandler`. `UI.Display` sets up the visual output using `vty`, while `UI.EventHandler` listens for key events and updates the editor state. Youâ€™ll also need to load the buffer with `Core.Buffer.loadBuffer` and highlight syntax with `UI.SyntaxHighlight.highlightLine`.

## Big Hint
The heart of the editor lies in how it manages and updates the `EditorState`, which is defined in `Core.Types`. This state includes the file buffer, cursor position, and current mode (e.g., Normal, Insert). Movement commands are handled in `Core.Cursor.moveCursor`, while text input and deletion are handled in `UI.EventHandler`. The `SyntaxHighlight` module handles colorizing different languages based on file extension. Pay special attention to the render loop in `UI.Render` and how it calls `renderBuffer` and `renderStatusBar`.
