Integrate Lua into your Rust-based terminal text editor to allow custom scripting and plugin support. The integration process involves creating a modular system where Lua scripts can interact with the Rust core.

1. **Modular Design**: Introduce a dedicated module (`lua_integration.rs`) to handle all Lua-related functionalities. This separation ensures that Lua integration does not clutter the core editor logic and allows for easier maintenance and scalability.

2. **Embedding Lua`**: Utilize appropriate crate to embed a Lua interpreter within the Rust application. The crate provides the necessary tools to execute Lua scripts, manage Lua state, and facilitate communication between Rust and Lua.

3. **Exposing Editor Functions to Lua**: Created Lua-accessible functions within the `LuaPluginManager` that allow Lua scripts to interact with the editor. For instance, functions like `insert_text` enable Lua scripts to manipulate the editor's content directly and `execute_command` to run custom lua commands.

4. **Command Registration System**: Implemente a system where Lua scripts can register custom commands using a `register_command` function. These commands can then be invoked from within the editor, providing users with the ability to extend editor functionalities dynamically.

5. **Handling Rust Ownership and Lifetimes**: Addresse Rust's strict ownership and borrowing rules by using `Rc<RefCell<App>>` and `Weak<RefCell<App>>`. 

6. **Error Handling and Stability**: Incorporate comprehensive error handling to manage potential issues arising from Lua script execution. This ensures that the editor remains stable even if Lua scripts encounter errors or behave unexpectedly.

7. **Script Loading Mechanism**: Developed a mechanism to load and execute Lua scripts from a designated `solution/lua_scripts/` directory. This allows users to add or modify scripts without altering the Rust codebase, promoting a plugin-friendly environment.
